# The Marvellous Suspender

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/tms/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/tms)

"**The Marvellous Suspender**" is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who find that chrome is consuming too much system resource or suffer from frequent chrome crashing. Totally based on the original "[The Great Suspender](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender)" but without ADS tracking and problems explained [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263).

Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically *suspend* tabs that have not been used for a default, or user-configurable, time interval. As a result, resources such as memory and CPU that the tab was consuming are freed.

If you have suggestions or problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/gioxx/MarvellousSuspender/issues/).

**If you have lost tabs from your browser** you can read a guide for how to recover them [here](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526
).

## Chrome Web Store

The Marvellous Suspender is [available via the official Chrome Web Store](https://go.gioxx.org/tgs).

For more information on the permissions required for the extension, please refer to this gitHub issue: (https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/213)
